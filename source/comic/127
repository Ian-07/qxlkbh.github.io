extra===
Thus we have established the existence of camera I, camera II, and camera III, (who we're planning to use in the future as well). Of course, III doesn't appear at all here <!-- and I plan to have them never appear at all -->but they clearly exist, to film the other two.

And yeah, cam 1 loathes cam 2. For unspecified reasons.<br>

Also wow it's been a long time since the last comic.
