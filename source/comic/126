Sorry about the wait everybody-- we're going to start putting up our commentary soon. It's a bit of a lot though so I'm just gonna publish the comic for now.<br>
<br>
musija's commentary:<br>
well, I had the original idea for this comic of course. I think I came up with it in like 1880 or something like that, I don't remember the exact year. I remember I was practicing Olivier Messiaen's Vingt Regards when I<br>
suddenly got the idea for the joke here. The<br>
other authors seemed to think it was pretty funny when I finally got around to telling them<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Obviously La Croix is eating a pomegranate in the last panel. I know I usually complain about drawing LC because they're difficult to draw but the Animesque artstyle I used specifically for Judith was way trickier to do, definitely way out of my comfort zone. I am proud of how that turned out, though-- it actually looks kinda good for once? Almost professional quality? I know usually I'm just self-deprecating my art but fr I feel like this was pretty good, and I didn't even take that long to<br>
draw it.<br>
<br>
andrew's commentary:<br>
I rather vividly know that I created the joke in 2005, as part of a standup set. Now I don't remember if I used it then - if I did you can write to us - but the punchline about the pomegranate was cool.<br>
<br>
Judith was drawn with the anime art style, which was on purpose to reinforce that she was a special character. There was also her thematically named brother Judas, whose lisp caused him quite a few problems - especially in the scene with the sentient apple uprising.<br>
<br>
About apples, this comic was rather fruit-centered, so we got to string together a lot of fruit jokes, like when MBS says "So... he's gone Bananas?", which I'm especially proud of. I sure hope all that hurried joke writing and sight gag drawing won't be lost to time, or anything like that.<br>
<br>
Ian's commentary:<br>
i vaguely remember thinking of the joke some time around 2:27:52 PM EDT on march 28, 2013. the pomegranate part i remember thinking was the most clever rule2 on earth, especially the incorporation of the trope Taken for Granite.<br>
<br>
funny how many velvet underground references i managed to squeeze in here. just absolutely loaded with them. the metal machine music one will probably elicit a lot of groans, especially the part where judith peraino gets drawn as an anime character, but it's a hill i'm willing to die on. conversely, the lumberjacks joke i thought was stupid, but i reluctantly decided to leave it in due to how popular it was with test audiences. at least we already had two of the three characters needed to make it work.<br>
<br>
oh and the lisp thing. i have to admit i didn't know much about lisp at the time, and i still don't, but i hear a lot of jokes about parentheses. this was around the time i first discovered xkcd.
