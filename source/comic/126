Sorry about the wait everybody-- we're going to start putting up our commentary soon. It's a bit of a lot though so I'm just gonna publish the comic for now.<br>
<br>
musija's commentary:<br>
well, I had the original idea for this comic of course. I think I came up with it in like 1880 or something like that, I don't remember the exact year. I remember I was practicing Olivier Messiaen's Vingt Regards when I<br>
suddenly got the idea for the joke here. The<br>
other authors seemed to think it was pretty funny when I finally got around to telling them<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Obviously La Croix is eating a pomegranate in the last panel. I know I usually complain about drawing LC because they're difficult to draw but the Animesque artstyle I used specifically for Judith was way trickier to do, definitely way out of my comfort zone. I am proud of how that turned out, though-- it actually looks kinda good for once? Almost professional quality? I know usually I'm just self-deprecating my art but fr I feel like this was pretty good, and I didn't even take that long to<br>
draw it.
