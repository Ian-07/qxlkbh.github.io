A more experienced troper has pointed out that this is probably more Idiosyncratic Episode Naming, in tvtropes terminology. However, [insert retort].<br>
<br>
Also, I was considering just having this a noodle incident, but I guess this still leaves things sufficiently vague and up to the reader's imagination anyway. Granted, our self-imposed rules on what's acceptable subject matter for qxlkbh probably wouldn't allow us to get LESS vague anyway.<br>

what am I doing? this is qxlkbh. This sort of meta commentary mentioning a ton of tropes belongs IN the comic.
