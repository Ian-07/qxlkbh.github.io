I mean, this isn't entirely fair. At least usually the backstory is actually remotely relevant to the story in like actual comics. But like, I saw a joke to make, so I made it, ya know?
<br />
Also re: title text: this was a conscious choice I made specifically; LC is annoying to draw by qxlkbh standards so it would have been easier just to draw noncanon-human-past-la-croix doing something rather than la croix. But yeah.
<br />
Also hooray I guess la croix just made fanfiction or something. I guess for qxlkbh it's always good that our canon is growing more tangled and hard to follow.
<br />
(But yeah what LC is saying here <em>isn't</em> canon. Canonically.)
<br />
In retrospect I feel like I was missing a joke about matrices or something but like whatever.
<br />
Also wow that's a lot of commentary.
