<br>
lovely, isn't it?<br>
<br>
watching the skies turn violet<br>
and the clouds pink?<br>
<br>
seeing the light fade away<br>
<br>
and the sun slowly <br>
disappear over the horizon<br>
<br>
until there is nothing left in the skies<br>
<br>
but the moon and the stars?<br>
<br>
sunset is a blessing.<br>
what more could we want?<br>
<br>
what would we ask for?<br>
<br>
actually i'm waiting for<br>
my date with<br>
the Most<br>
Beautiful<br>
Stickman.<br>
<br>
(on phone) la Croix i'm taking<br>
you to canon court<br>
