Personally I feel like the legibility here is even worse than normal, so here's a transcript:<br>
Dandan: "Do Illegal actions occur canonically"<br>
Musija: "uhh are you playing a nomic, Dandan?"<br>
D: "maybe"<br>
<br>
Andrew: "Why is this comic as meta as it is?"<br>
M: "uhh because that's the niche we chose to occupy"<br>
<br>
A: "When did this comic begin?"  (reflectively) "... over half a month ago"<br>
M: "Webcomic time™"<br>
<br>
A: "Will anyone ask normal questions?"<br>
M: "[xɬpʼχʷɬtʰɬpʰɬːskʷʰt͡sʼ]"<br>
A: "What do bunchberries have to do with anything"
