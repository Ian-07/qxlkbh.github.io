this even predates proto-1 and proto-2. It was just a one-off joke thing I (musija) made a long time (over a year, as of uploading on February 23, 2023; it dates to february 17, 2022) ago, about the subtitles Olivier Messiaen gives for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovMnmIoZh74">Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-JÃ©sus</a> (which is a superbly excellent piano suite, though definitely a little bit of an acquired taste). Anyway, I suppose technically this could be considered the first installment in the qxlkbh universe due to LC's presence.

the french here isn't very great, of course. I think. 

Rough translation, though:

(1) love my son plz gotta go over there adieu
(5) does anyone have a mirror
(7) hello little baby! I know something cool: you're going to be a a preacher in my arms, because you're going to die in my arms. really funny right?

I'm going to say that it's canon that LC can speak french.
