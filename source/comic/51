Some observations:<br>
- the third person from the left (in the hat) is the cheese mite from <a href="/e3">proto-1</a><br>
- the fourth person from the left (the table) is the spilled tea table from <a href="/14"></a> (not covered in spilled tea because they have a sense of hygiene of course)<br>
- the cake evidently mysteriously disappeared, between #50 and #51; it certainly wasn't eaten by anyone at #50.<br>
- musija could have made the comic center on the fate of the cake instead and it would have been much more entertaining<br>
