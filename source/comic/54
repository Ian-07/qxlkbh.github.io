Re: La Croix's Character:<br>
Inconveniencing people is what they [La Croix] LOVE to do. But not like, actively causing significant harm. They're not a villain, they're just kind of a troll. In particular, LC wouldn't e.g. turn to a life of crime and villainy or something. They're an unsavory actor in society, not someone trying to destroy it from without. - musija<br>
Actual character development coming soon™™™™™.
