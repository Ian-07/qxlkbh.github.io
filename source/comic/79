extra===
These extra bonus text things are going to contain the current ruleset just for the readers's reference, below any commentary we might have.

Also, it's actually true that Mous, Sonata, Dandan, and Musija (and sometimes Planet) have played a nomic together. We're probably going to make a lot of injokey references to things that happened there.

Sorry I know for a lot of you this comic won't display in one screen. Each panel does tho so imo it's not bad.

<h2>RULES:</h2>
(1) anyone can make a proposal<br>
(2) a player may make a proposal by writing it down and showing it to the other players<br>
(3) to vote for a proposal a player states that they are voting for it, and similarly for voting against a proposal or abstaining.<br>
(4) if a proposal has more than two votes for it and nobody has stated that they abstain or are voting against it, it passes.<br>
(5) if a proposal has more than two votes for it, fewer votes against than votes for, and has existed for at least 5 minutes, then it is passed<br>
(6) passed rules are added to the ruleset.<br>
(7) all other actions are disallowed by default<br>
(8) a player may do at most one of voting for or against a proposal (or abstaining on it). However they can change their decision any time.<br>
