  <h1>Info and stuff</h1>
  <p>qxlkbh is a webcomic which is for the most part very meta; it's an example of metafiction. Most of the humor is

  <br />
  <p>the authors include: <br />
    Moooosey (also "musija" or "musi"), who has way too many interests and is consequently an amateur linguist,
    mathematician, and composer <br />

  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h2>Q: How do I pronounce "qxlkbh"</h2>
  <p>A: [qxlkbh], in ipa. Sorry.</p>
  <h2>Q: Why are the navigation buttons the opposite of how they're supposed to be</h2>
  <p>A: to mess with the readership, basically. It's essentially a joke about the unaesthetic aesthetic of the website.
  </p>
  <h2>Q: I want to yell at you, how I can I contact you</h2>
  <p>A: it's probably easiest if you just create an issue <a href=https://github.com/qxlkbh/qxlkbh.github.io/issues>here</a> for now.</p>
